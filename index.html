                <p>Machine Learning Researcher | ADAS Software Engineer | Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering</p>
                <p>Passionate about advancing autonomous systems. 
                    At Canoo, my role as an ADAS Software Engineer involves delivering advanced control systems and sensor fusion techniques to enhance vehicle safety. 
                    In this role, I have strengthened my programming skills in C++ and Python and gained hands-on experience in software development within the automotive industry. 
                    Previously, as a Machine Learning Researcher in Robotics at Cornell University, I developed a multi-modal pedestrian trajectory prediction model and a perception-feedback UAV system for dynamic human-robot interactions.
                    These projects, which resulted in multiple papers, have enhanced my expertise in perception, probabilistic reasoning, and human-robot interaction.</p>
